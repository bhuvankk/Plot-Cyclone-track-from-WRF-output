Plotting cyclone track from WRF output nc file
The lowest pressure is found in the netcdf file for each timestep and the track is generated. To minimise the run time an outer bound is to be provided by the region that encompasses the entire track or likely to encompass. An inner bound is also to be provided which is small area binding the approximate starting point.
The world shape file is not included here. Use any world shape file and provide file path accordingly
